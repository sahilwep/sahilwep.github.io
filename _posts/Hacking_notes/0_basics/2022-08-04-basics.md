# Basics Before Pentesting
    
Hey buddy i am using Linux as my OS . this notes containing the basics of linux commands , service , tools , configurations & many more.....


***
## Commands
***

**Navigating**

```bash
pwd     # Print working directory

cd      # Change directory

cd ~    # Change directory to your home directory

cd -    # Go back to previous directory

cd ..    # Go back to previous directory

```

**Looking at files and directory**

```bash
ls      # List files in directory

ls -la  # -llong listing format , -a hidden files 

ls -ltr     # Sort list by last modified. -time -reverse

file    # Show info about file. What type of file it is. If it is a binary or text file for example.

cat     # Output content of file.

less    # Output file but just little bit at a time. Use this one. Not more.

# Use /searchterm to search. It is the same command as in vim. n to scroll to next search result. Press q to quit.

more file.txt   #  Output file but just little bit at a time. less is better.

print file.txt  # print file content

strings file.txt    # show file content

xxd file.txt    # show the hex and content , usefull during CTF

echo *      #  * is used for printing everything in current directory , i mention this because sometime in CTF you dont have the permition for ls so we can use echo * as well  :)

wc -l file.txt      # wc print -l for lines of the file

wc -m file.txt      # print -m for character

wc -c file.txt      # print -c for bytes

grep *    # it is also usefull in CTF when we have limited permition and we want to see the content of directiory


```


**Pipe and Redirection**

```zsh

echo 'hello babe'  # print hello babe as output

echo 'hello babe' > file.txt     # '>' is used for redirection the optput in a file "file.txt" 

echo 'are you fine' >> file.txt     # '>>' is used for saving output in next line . if we use '>' ,then it will overwrite it . 

cat file.txt | grep babe    # cat will print the file content then pipe   |   is used to take output of the first command as input of second command and grep will find that 'baby' match ,if its there then it will show us.  

```

```bash
service apache2 status  # show server status.

service apache2 start  # it will start web-server on port 80 default on your localhost ip.

service apache2 stop    # for stopping.

# or

systemctl status apache2        #same as previous , we using systemctl command here.
